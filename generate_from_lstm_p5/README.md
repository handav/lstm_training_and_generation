To start the p5 sketch, navigate to the 'generate_from_lstm_p5' folder and type: 

```python -m SimpleHTTPServer```

Then in your browser, navigate to localhost:8000.

Once running, press any key to generate some text characters and add them to the array. 

When you have generated as much as you want, **press enter to save a "generated.txt" file**.

You can use this in create_midi if you've generated notes. This downloads the file to your default downloads folder. You should place generated.txt into the 'generated' folder in 'create_midi' to use the create_midi.py script.
