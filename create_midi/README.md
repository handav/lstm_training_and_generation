This turns a text file of note encodings into a midi file. Note: this only works for the encodings like in the 'notes.txt' file. To make it work with your own encoding, you have to change the code.

You'll need midiutil:

```
pip install midiutil
```

To run this program, type this into terminal:

```
python create_midi.py
```

I recommend downloading MuseScore (https://musescore.org/en) to view and play your MIDI.
