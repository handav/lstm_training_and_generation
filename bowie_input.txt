Someday they won't let you, so now you must agree
The times they are a-telling, and the changing isn't free
You've read it in the tea leaves, and the tracks are on TV
Beware the savage jaw
Of 1984
They'll split your pretty cranium, and fill it full of air
And tell that you're eighty, but brother, you won't care
You'll be shooting up on anything, tomorrow's never there
Beware the savage jaw
Of 1984
Come see, come see, remember me?
We played out an all night movie role
You said it would last, but I guess we enrolled
In 1984 (who could ask for more)
1984 (who could ask for mor-or-or-or-ore)
(Mor-or-or-or-ore)
I'm looking for a vehicle, I'm looking for a ride
I'm looking for a party, I'm looking for a side
I'm looking for the treason that I knew in '65
Beware the savage jaw
Of 1984
Come see, come see, remember me?
We played out an all night movie role
You said it would last, but I guess we enrolled
In 1984 (who could ask for more)
1984 (who could ask for mor-or-or-or-ore)
(Mor-or-or-or-ore)
1984 1984 1984 (more)
1984 1984 (more)
1984
I was a stranger in the city
Out of town where the people I knew
I had the feeling of self-pity
What to do? What to do? What to do?
The outlook was decidedly blue
But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've ever known
A foggy day in a london town
Had me low and had me down
I viewed the morning with alarm
The british museum had lost its charm
How long, I wondered, could this thing last?
But the age of miracles had'nt passed
For suddenly I saw you there
And through foggy london town the sun was shining everywhere
African nightmare one-time Mormon
More men fall in Hullabaloo men
I slide to the nearest bar
Undermine chairman I went too far
Bent on a windfall rent a sony
Wonder how the dollar went down
Gotta get a word to Elizabeth's father
Hey no, he wished me well
Seemed like another day
I could fly into the eye of god on high
His burning eye will see me through
One of these days, one of these days
Gotta get a word through one of these days
Asanti habari habari habari
Asanti nabana nabana nabana
Getting in mood for a Mombassa night flight
Pushing my luck, gonna fly like a mad thing
Bare strip takeoff skimming over Rhino
Born in slumber less than peace
Struggle with a child whose screaming dreaming
Drowned by the props all steely sunshine
Sick of you, sick of me
Lust for the free life
Quashed and maimed
Like a valuable loved one
Left unnamed
Seemed like another day
I could fly into the eye of god on high
Seemed like another day
I could fly into the eye of god on high
Over the bushland over the trees
Wise like Orangutan that was me
His burning eye will see me through
One of these days, one of these days
Gotta get a word through one of these days
His burning eye will see me through
One of these days, one of these days
Gotta get a word through one of these days
Asanti habari habari habari
Asanti nabana nabana nabana
Well Billy rapped all night
About his suicide
How he'd kick it in the head
When he was twenty-five
Speed jive don't want to stay alive
When you're twenty-five
And Wendy's stealing clothes
From Marks and Sparks
(unlocked cars)
And Freedy's got spots (zits)
From ripping off the stars from his face
Funky little boat race
Television man is crazy
Saying we're juvenile deliquent wrecks
Oh man I need tv
When I got T Rex
Oh brother you guessed
I'm a dude dad
All the young dudes
(Hey dudes)

(And I want to talk to you all of you)

Now Lucy looks sweet
'cause he dresses like a queen
But he can kick like a mule
It's a real
Mean team
But we can love
Oh yes we can love
And my brother's back at home
With his Beatles and his Stones
We never got it off
On that revolution stuff
What a drag
Too many snags
Now I've drunk a lot of wine
And I'm feeling fine
Got to race
Some cat to bed
Oh is there concrete all around
Or is it in my head
Yeah I'm a dude dad
All the young dudes

I'm lazy
You're crazy, girl
Stay by my side
I'm scared you'll
Meet someone
In whom you'll confide
[Chorus]
Life's still a dream
Your love's amazing
Since I found you
My life's amazing
I pledge you
You'll never be blue
There's too much at stake to be down
My nightmare
Rooted here watching you go
Divine in both, our lives
[Chorus]
My life's a roll
Go go go
And it's amazing
And I say to myself
I've got it wrong, wrong, wrong
She is a play-girl
She the wrong wrong girl for me
And I say to myself
You're a fool, fool, fool
She doesn't love you
She doesn't need you, this I know
She's got a trail of men that she takes
Wherever she goes
She hasn't the strength to love any single man for a length of time
[And I say to myself]
Ooh, I don't stand a chance
[And I say to myself]
It's a long long romance
[And I say to myself]
Well, she's out to slay
[And I say to myself]
Well, she's got it made
[And I say to myself]
Oh yeah, oh yeah
[And I say to myself]
Oh yeah
And I say to myself that she shouldn't love anybody else in the world but me
And I say to myself
Forget her now, now, now
She don't want you
She don't love you anymore
And I say to myself you're a fool, fool, fool
She's don't love you
She don't need you, this I know
And I turn around and look at myself
You'll never get her, you're a fool
Say after me I'm a fool- I'm a fool
[And I say to myself]
I can't get what I want
[And I say to myself]
And it makes me sad
[And I say to myself]
I can't get what I want
[And I say to myself]
And it makes me mad
[And I say to myself]
Oh yeah, oh yeah
[And I say to myself]
Oh yeah
And I say to myself that she shouldn't love anybody else in the world but me,
Yeah
Yeah
[And I say to myself]
Oh, I feel so sad
[And I say to myself]
She's making me mad
[And I say to myself]
And I say to myself
[And I say to myself]
That I love her
[And I say to myself]
And I say to myself that I need her
[And I say to myself]
Oh, I need her
And I say to myself I'm a fool
And I say to myself
Arnold Layne
Had a strange hobby
Collecting clothes
Moonshine washing line
They suit him fine
On the wall hung
A tall mirror
Distorted view
See through baby blue
He dug it
Oh, Arnold Layne
It's not the same
Takes two to know
Two to know
Two to know
Two to know
Why can't you see?
Arnold Layne
Arnold Layne
Arnold Layne
Arnold Layne
Now he's caught
A nasty sort
Of person
They gave him time
Doors bang
Chain gang
He hates it
Oh, Arnold Layne
It's not the same
Takes do it now
Do it now
Do it now
Do it now
Why can't you see?
Arnold Layne
Arnold Layne
Arnold Layne
Arnold Layne
Don't do it again
There's such a sad love
Deep in your eyes, a kind of pale jewel
Open and closed within your eyes
I'll place the sky in your eyes
There's such a fooled heart
Beating so fast in search of new dreams
A love that will last within your heart
I'll place the moon within your heart
As the pain sweeps through
Makes no sense for you
Every thrill has gone
Wasn't too much fun at all
But I'll be there for you
As the world falls down
Falling
(As the world) Falling down
Falling in love
I'll paint you mornings of gold
I'll spin you Valentine evenings
Though we're strangers till now
We're choosing the path between the stars
I'll leave my love between the stars
As the pain sweeps through
Makes no sense for you
Every thrill has gone
Wasn't too much fun at all
But I'll be there for you
As the world falls down
Falling
(As the world) Falling down
Falling
As the world falls down
Falling
Falling
Falling
Falling in love
As the world falls down
(Down) Falling

I'm just a rock star stabbing away
I take the - I take the leave for another day
I'm [?]
Just let me know if I sing too much
When you're head over heals and the magic is there but impossible
Possible
Impossible
And when the police take me away
Possible
Impossible
It wasn't you it was mothers' day
Let's get this show on the road
Let's get Atomica
Let's rock till we explode
Let's get Atomica
They protect you from the voices
Protect from the visions
Protect you from the silence for another day
These rotten people sure know how to live
When you're head over heels and the magic is gone it's impossible,
impossible
Impossible
Impossible
That we should swim in a covered up pool
Impossible
Impossible
By the white trees dressed in double true
Let's get this show on the road
Let's get Atomica
Let's rock till we explode
Let's get Atomica
I hold myself like a god
Like a god
[4xs] -Like
I'm just a pop star jumping away
I leave the - I leave the sins for another day
A little puny, and just let me know, if I talk too much
When you're head over heels and the magic is there but impossible
Impossible
Impossible
That we should swim in a covered up pool
Impossible
Impossible
By the white trees dressed in double true
Let's get this show on the road
Let's get Atomica
Let's rock till we explode
Let's get Atomica

Oooooooo...
Weaving down a byroad, singing the song
That's my kind of highroad gone wrong
My-my
Smile at least
You can't say no to the Beauty and the Beast
Something in the night
Something in the day
Nothing is wrong but darling
Something's in the way
There's slaughter in the air
Protest on the wind
Someone else inside me
Someone could get skinned, how?
My-my
Someone fetch a priest
You can't say no to the Beauty and the Beast
Darling
My-my
You can't say no to the Beauty and the Beast
(Liebling)
My-my
You can't say no to the Beauty and the Beast
I wanted to believe me
I wanted to be good
I wanted no distractions
Like every good boy should
My-my
Nothing will corrupt us
Nothing will compete
Thank god heaven left us
Standing on our feet
My-my
Beauty and the Beast
My-my
Just Beauty and the Beast
You can't say no to the Beauty and the Beast
Darling
My-my
My

Blue Jean, I just met me a girl named Blue Jean
Blue Jean, she got a camouflaged face and no money
Remember they always let you down when you need 'em
Oh, Blue Jean, is heaven any sweeter than Blue Jean
She got a police bike
She got a turned up nose
Sometimes I feel like
(Oh, the whole human race)
Jazzin' for Blue Jean
(Oh, and when my Blue Jean's blue)
Blue Jean can send me
(Oh, somebody send me)
Somebody send me
(Oh, somebody send me)
One day I'm gonna write a poem in a letter
One day I'm gonna get that faculty together
Remember that everybody has to wait in line
Blue Jean, look out world you know I've got mine
She got Latin roots
She got everything.
[Chorus]
All clear wail the sirens
Sunshine on the wasteland
Old man sitting in the white sand
Think we're in for a big surprise
Right between the eyes
Seemed a good idea
To drop a bomb on the wasteland here
Only one man could be seen
And he was old and so serene
Captain sat in his deck chair
And the red light flashed Beware
Pilot felt quite big-time
As the bomb sailed through the air
Well, they danced and sang
When the bang went bang
When the lights popped out
And the smoke began to clear
It was positively queer
[Chorus]
Die said the General
Cobblers said the man
So the Pentagon sent a cable
And the Queen a telegram
A-bombs, H-bombs, even very small ones
Ripped apart that sand
'Til the stench was just revolting
And the sky a greenish tan
But the soldier said Sir,
There's a crack in the world
And the figures went squash,
And the bits flew far and wide
How the universe sighed!
[Chorus: x2]
When the smoke had blown away
There was nothing left to view
Except a man dear Lord who looked like you
Floating high up in the sky
You promised me the ending would be clear
You'd let me know when the time was now
Don't let me know when you're opening the door
Stab me in the dark, let me disappear
Memories that flutter like bats out of hell
Stab you from the city spires
Life wasn't worth the balance
Or the crumpled paper it was written on
Don't let me know we're invisible
Don't let me know we're invisible
Hot cash days that you trailed around
Cold cold nights under chrome and glass
Led me down river of perfumed limbs
Sent me to the streets with the good time girls
Don't let me know we're invisible
Don't let me know we're invisible
We could dance, dance, dance through' the fire
Dance, dance, dance through' the fire
Feed me no lies
I don't know about you, I don't know about you
Breathe through the years
I don't know about you, I don't know about you
Bring me the disco king
I don't know about you, I don't know about you
Dead or alive, bring me the disco king
Bring me the disco king, bring me the disco king
Bring me the disco king
Spin-offs with those who slept like corpses
Damp morning rays in the stiff bad clubs
Killing time in the '70s
Smelling of love through the moist winds
Don't let me know when you're opening the door
Close me in the dark, let me disappear
Soon there'll be nothing left of me
Nothing left to release
Dance, dance, dance through' the fire
Dance, dance, dance through' the fire
Feed me no lies
I don't know about you, I don't know about you
Breathe through the years
I don't know about you, I don't know about you
Bring me the disco king
I don't know about you, I don't know about you
Dead or alive, bring me the disco king
Bring me the disco king
Bring me the disco king, bring me the disco king
Bring me the disco king, bring me the disco king
Bring me the disco king, bring me the disco king
Sitting here wishing on a cement floor
Just wishing that I had just something you wore
I put it on when I go lonely
Will you take off your dress and send it to me?
I miss your kissin' and I miss your head
And a letter in your writing doesn't mean you're not dead
Run outside in the desert heat
Make your dress all wet and send it to me
I miss your soup and I miss your bread
And a letter in your writing doesn't mean you're not dead
So spill your breakfast and drip your wine
Just wear that dress when you're die
D-A-V-I-D
Sitting here wishing on a cement floor
Just wishing that I had just something you wore
Bloody your hands on a cactus tree
Wipe it on your dress and send it to me
Sitting here wishing on a cement floor
Just wishing that I had just something you wore
When the sun goes down (when the sun goes down)
And the bats are back to bed (and the bats are back)
The brothers come 'round (the brothers come 'round)
I get out of my dirty bed (my dirty bed)
I shake my pretty little head (I shake my pretty little head)
Tap my pretty little feet (tap my pretty little feet)
Feeling brighter than sunlight (oh)
Louder than thunder (oh)
Bouncing like a yo-yo, whoa (oh)
Don't got no problems (no problems)
Ain't got no suitcase (no suitcase)
Ain't got no clothes to worry about (no clothes to worry about)
Ain't got no real estate or jewelry or gold mines to hang me up.
I just throw in my hand (throw in my hand)
With the chilliest bunch in the land (in the land)
They don't look much (oh)
They sure chilly chilly (oh)
They positively glow glow, huh (oh)
Chilly down with the fire gang
Think small with the fire gang (It's the only way)
Bad hep with the fire gang (a smile a day keeps the doctor away)
When your thing gets wild
Chilly down
Chilly down with the fire gang (Hey, I'm a wild child)
Act tall with the fire gang (whoo, walk tall)
Good times, bad food (yeah)
When your thing gets wild
Chilly down, chilly down
Drive you crazy, really lazy, eye rollin', funky strollin', ball playin'
Hip swayin', trouble makin', booty shakin', tripping, passing, jumping
Bouncing, drivin', stylin', creeping, pouncing, shoutin', screamin'
Double dealin', rockin', rollin', and a reelin'
With the mackin' sex appealin'.
Can you dig our groovy feelin'?
So when things get too tough (get too tough)
And your chin is dragging on the ground (dragging on the ground)
And even down looks up (down looks up)
Bad luck heh heh,
We can show you a good time (show you a good time)
And we don't charge nothin' (nothin' at all)
Just strut your nasty stuff,
Wiggle in the middle yeh
Get the town talkin', fire gang
Chilly down with the fire gang (think small)
Think small with the fire gang
Bad hep with the fire gang (hey, listen up)
When your thing gets wild
Chilly down
Chilly down with the fire gang (hey, shake your pretty little head)
Think small with the fire gang (tap your pretty little feet)
Good times, bad food (come on, come on)
When your thing gets wild
Chilly down
Chilly down with the fire gang (wooh)
Think small with the fire gang
Bad hep with the fire gang
I could escape this feeling, with my China Girl
I feel a wreck without my, little China Girl
I hear her heart beating, loud as thunder
Saw the stars crashing
I'm a mess without my, little China Girl
Wake up mornings where's my, little China Girl
I hear hearts beating, loud as thunder
Saw the stars crashing down
I feel a-tragic like I'm Marlon Brando
When I look at my China Girl
I could pretend nothing really meant too much
When I look at my China Girl
I stumble into town just like a sacred cow
Visions of swastikas in my head
Plans for everyone
It's in the way of my eyes
My little China Girl
You shouldn't mess with me
I'll ruin everything you are
I'll give you television
I'll give you eyes of blue
I'll give your man the words to rule the world
And when I get excited
My little China Girl says
Oh baby just you shut your mouth
She says... sh-sh-shhh
Hello,
Is there anybody in there
Just nod if you can hear me
Is there anyone home?
Come on, now
I hear you're feeling down
I can ease your pain
Get you on your feet again
Relax
I'll need some information first
Just the basic facts
Can you show me where it hurts?
There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship's smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons
Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain, you would not understand
This is not how I am
I have become comfortably numb
O. K.
Just a little pin prick
There'll be no more aaaaaaaah!
But you may feel a little sick
Can you stand up?
I do believe it's working, good
That'll keep you going through the show
Come on it's time to go.
There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship's smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child
I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look, but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown
The dream is gone
I have become comfortably numb.
I took this walk
To ease my mind
To find out what's gnawing at me
Wouldn't think, to look at me,
That I've spent a lot of time in education
It all seems so long ago
I'm a thinker, not a talker
I've no-one to talk to, anyway
I can't see the road
For the rain in my eyes
Ahhh-huh, h... Uh, huh
I live above the grocers store,
Owned by an Austrian
He often calls me down to eat
And he jokes about his broken English,
Tries to be a friend to me
But for all my years
Of reading conversation,
I stand without a word to say
I can't see the bridge
For the rain in my eyes
Ahhh-huh, h... Uh, huh
And the world is full of life
Full of folk who don't know me
And they walk in twos or threes or more
While the light
That shines above the grocer's store
Investigates my face so rudely
And my essays lying
Scattered on the floor
Fulfill their needs just by being there
And my hands shake, my head hurts,
My voice sticks inside my throat
I'm invisible and dumb
No-one will recall me
And I can't see the water
Through the tears in my ey-y-yes
Ahhh-huh, h... Uh, huh
You never told me of your other faces
You were the widow of a wild cat
And now I know about your special kisses
And I know you know where that's at
I guess I recognize your destination
I think I see beneath your makeup
What you want is so separation
This is no ordinary
This is no ordinary
(Oh, oh, oh)
What a criminal world
The boys are like baby-faced girls
What a criminal girl
She'll show you where to shoot your gun
What a typical mother's son
The only thing that she enjoys
Is a criminal world
Where the girls are like baby-faced boys
You've got a very heavy reputation
But no-one knows about your low-life
I know a way to find a situation
And hold a candle to your high-life disguise
You caught me kneeling at your sister's door
That was no ordinary stick-up
I'm well aware just what you're looking for
I am no ordinary
I am no ordinary
(Oh, oh, oh)
What a criminal world
The boys are like baby-faced boys
What a criminal girl
She'll show you where to shoot your gun
What a typical mother's son
The only thing that she enjoys
Is a criminal world
Where the girls are like baby-faced boys
Baby-faced boys
Baby-face
What a criminal world
What a criminal
Criminal
What a criminal world
What a criminal
Criminal
I bless you madly,
Sadly as I tie my shoes
I love you badly,
Just in time, at times, I guess
Because of you I need to rest
Because it's you
That sets the test
So much has gone
And little is new
And as the sparrow sings
Dawn chorus for
Someone else to hear
The Thinker sits alone growing older
And so bitter
I gave Them life
I gave Them all
They drained my very soul
...Dry
I crushed my heart
To ease their pains
No thought for me remains there
Nothing can they spare
What of me?
Who praised their efforts
To be free?
Words of strength and care
And sympathy
I opened doors
That would have blocked their way
I braved their cause to guide,
For little pay
I ravaged at my finance just for those
Those whose claims were steeped in peace, tranquility
Those who said a new world, new ways ever free
Those whose promises stretched in hope and grace for me
I bless you madly,
Sadly as I tie my shoes
I love you badly, just in time,
At times, I guess
Because of you I need to rest, oh yes
Because it's you
That sets the test
So much has gone
And little is new
And as the sunrise stream
Flickers on me,
My friends talk
Of glory, untold dream, where all is God and God is just a word
We had a friend, a talking man
Who spoke of many powers that he had
Not of the best of men, but ours
We used him
We let him use his powers
We let him fill our needs
Now we are strong
And the road is coming to its end
Now the damned have no time to make amends
No purse of token fortune stands in our way
The silent guns of love
Will blast the sky
We broke the ruptured structure built of age
Our weapons were the tongues of crying rage
Where money stood
We planted seeds of rebirth
And stabbed the backs of fathers
Sons of dirt
Infiltrated business cesspools
Hating through our sleeves
Yea, and we slit the Catholic throat
Stoned the poor
On slogans such as
'Wish You Could Hear'
'Love Is All We Need'
'Kick Out The Jams'
'Kick Out Your Mother'
'Cut Up Your Friend'
'Screw Up Your Brother or He'll Get You In the End'
And we know the flag of love is from above
And we can force you to be free
And we can force you to believe
And I close my eyes and tighten up my brain
For I once read a book in which the lovers were slain
For they knew not the words of the Free States' refrain
It said:
I believe in the power of good
I believe in the state of love
I will fight for the right to be right
I will kill for the good of the fight for the right to be right
And I open my eyes to look around
And I see a child laid slain
On the ground
As a love machine lumbers through desolation rows
Plowing down man, woman, listening to its command
But not hearing anymore
Not hearing anymore
Just the shrieks from the old rich
And I want to believe
In the madness that calls 'Now'
And I want to believe
That a light's shining through
Somehow
And I want to believe
And you want to believe
And we want to believe
And we want to live
Oh, we want to live
We want to live
We want to live
We want to live
We want to live
We want to live
I want to live
I want to live
I want to live
I want to live
I want to live
I want to live
Live
Live
Live
Ok, talk to you,
South America, Australia
France, Germany
U.K., Africa
Calling out around the world
Are you ready for a brand new beat
Summer's here and the time is right
For dancing in the streets
They're dancing in Chicago
Down in New Orleans, in New York city
All we need is music, sweet music
There'll be music everywhere
They'll be swinging, swaying, records playing
And dancing in the street, oh
It doesn't matter what you wear
Just as long as you are there
So come on, every guy grab a girl,
Everywhere, around the world
They'll be dancing, dancing in the street
It's an invitation across the nation
A chance for folks to meet
They'll be laughing and singing, and music swinging
And dancing in the street
Philadelphia, P.A., Baltimore in D.C. now
Don't forget the Motor City
On the streets of Brazil
Back in the U.S.S.R., don't matter where you are
All we need is music, sweet music
There'll be music everywhere
They'll be swinging, swaying, records playing
And dancing in the street, oh
It doesn't matter what you wear
Just as long as you are there
So come on every guy, grab a girl
Everywhere, around the world
They'll be dancing, dancing in the streets
Way down in L. A. Everyday
Dancing in the streets
Cross in China too, me and you
Dancing in the street
Don't you know
They'll be dancing
Dancing in the street
Don't you know
They'll be da, da, da, da
Dancing, dancing in the street
Day-In Day-Out
Stay-In Fade-Out
Day-In Oo Oo
Day-Out Oo Oo Oo
She was born in a handbag
love left on a doorstep
What she lacks is a backup
nothing seems to make a dent
Gonna find her some money honey
try to pay her rent
That's the kind of protection everyone is shouting about
CHORUS
Day-In Day-Out
Stay-In Fade-Out
Day-In Oo Oo
Day-Out Oo Oo Oo
First thing she learns is she's a citizen,
some things they turn out right
When you're under the USA
something rings a bell and it's all over
She's going out her way
stealing for that one good rush
Day-In Day-Out
Stay-In Fade-Out
She could use a little money
she's hangin' on his arms like a cheap suit
She's got no money, honey
she's the other side
Oh come on little baby
late night, big town, police, shake down
Oo Oo
Oo Oo
Day-In Day-Out
Stay-In Fade-Out
Oo Oo
Oo Oo
Day-In Day-Out
Stay-In Fade-Out
She's got a ticket to nowhere
she's gonna take a train ride
Nobody knows her, or knows her name
she's in the pocket of a home boy
Oo she's gonna take her a shotgun Pow
spin the grail spin the drug
She's gonna make them well aware
she's an angry gal
Day-In Day-Out
Stay-In Fade-Out
Suddenly there's angels everywhere
Angels in a ton of sound
And they shootin' her down
Shootin her with video-drugs-bullets and promises
Hold me tight
Keep me cool
Going mad
Don't know what to do
Do I need a friend?
Well, I need one now
All the days of my life
All the days of my life
All the days I owe you
All I've done
I've done for me
All you gave
You gave for free
I gave nothing in return
And there's little left of me
All the days of my life
All the days of my life
All the days I owe you
In red-eyed pain I'm knocking on your door again
My crazy brain in tangles
Pleading for your gentle voice
Those storms keep pounding through my head and heart
I pray you'll soothe my sorry soul
All the days of my life
All the days of my life
All the days I owe you
All the days of my life
All the days of my life
All the days I owe you
All the days of my life
All the days of my life
All the days I owe you
And when she drowns
Within and in the fizzy gin, begins to sigh
Good God, oh my, I cry
And die, and lie beside
She is the apple in my eye
She talked to God
I couldn't cope or'd hope eloped
A dope she roped this salty lie
And when she's dreaming, I believe
And when she's reading, I retreat
Can't believe her telling me she's dead again
Telling me she's dead against it
And deep my wound
Within for every second chance it was thy tore
From deep within despite the rain
My words are worn
She loves to talk into the phone
No matter who, no matter when
No matter where
No better than the faulty line
And when she's dreaming, I believe
And when she's reading, I retreat
Can't believe her telling me she's dead again
Telling me she's dead against it
He swivels his head
Tears his eyes from the screen
As his past puts him back in Atlantic City
There's not even a demon in Heaven or Hell
Is it all just human disguise?
As I walk down the aisle
Gone gone gone spinning slack through the end?
Deadens? my brain falling up through the years
Till I swivel back round then I fly fly fly
Losing breath from the water then I'm gone gone gone
And I'm gone gone gone
Now I'm older than movies
Let me dance away
Now I'm wiser than dreams
Let me fly fly fly
While I'm touching tomorrow
And I know who's there
When silhouettes fall
And I'm gone
Like I'm dancing on angels
And I'm gone through a crack in the past
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man walking
Three old men dancing under the lamplight
Shaking their sex and their bones
And the boys that we were
An alien nation in therapy
Sliding naked and new
Like a bad tempered child
On a rain slicked street
Gone gone gone spinning slack through the end?
Deadens? my brain falling up through the years
Till I swivel back round then I fly fly fly
Losing breath from the water then I'm gone gone gone
And I'm gone
And I'm gone, like I'm dancing on angels
And I'm gone, through the crack in the past
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man
Like a dead man walking
And I'm gone gone gone
Let me dance dance dance
And I'm gone gone gone
Let me dance dance dance
And I'm gone, like I'm dancing on angels
And I'm gone, through a crack in the past
And I'm gone, like I'm dancing on angels
And I'm gone, through a crack in the past
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man
Like a dead man walking
This ain't rock'n'roll. This is genocide!
As they pulled you out of the oxygen tent
You asked for the latest party
With your silicone hump and your ten inch stump
Dressed like a priest you was
Todd Browning's freak you was
Crawling down the alley on your hands and knee
I'm sure you're not protected, for it's plain to see
The diamond dogs are poachers and they hide behind trees
Hunt you to the ground they will, mannequins with kill appeal
(Will they come?)
I'll keep a friend serene
(Will they come?)
Oh baby, come unto me
(Will they come?)
Well, she's come, been and gone.
Come out of the garden, baby
You'll catch your death in the fog
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
The Halloween Jack is a real cool cat
And he lives on top of Manhattan Chase
The elevator's broke, so he slides down a rope
Onto the street below, oh Tarzie, go man go
Meet his little hussy with his ghost town approach
Her face is sans feature, but she wears a Dali brooch
Sweetly reminiscent, something mother used to bake
Wrecked up and paralyzed, Diamond Dogs are stabilized
(Will they come?)
I'll keep a friend serene
(Will they come?)
Oh baby, come unto me
(Will they come?)
Well, she's come, been and gone.
Come out of the garden, baby
You'll catch your death in the fog
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Oo-oo-ooh, call them the Diamond Dogs
Oo-oo-ooh, call them the Diamond Dogs
In the year of the scavenger, the season of the bitch
Sashay on the boardwalk, scurry to the ditch
Just another future song, lonely little kitsch
(There's gonna be sorrow) try and wake up tomorrow
(Will they come?)
I'll keep a friend serene
(Will they come?)
Oh baby, come unto me
(Will they come?)
Well, she's come, been and gone.
Come out of the garden, baby
You'll catch your death in the fog
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Oo-oo-ooh, call them the Diamond Dogs
Oo-oo-ooh, call them the Diamond Dogs
Bow-wow, woof woof, bow-wow, wow
Call them the Diamond Dogs
Dogs
Call them the Diamond Dogs, call them, call them
Call them the Diamond Dogs, call them, call them, ooo
Call them the Diamond Dogs
Keep cool
Diamond Dogs rule, OK
Hey-hey-hey-hey
Beware of the Diamond Dogs
Beware of the Diamond Dogs
Did you ever have a dream or two
Where the hero is a guy named you
And the things he does are just too much
Does he fly like Mr. Superman, speak Chinese, French and Dutch?
And did you ever have a dream or two?
Have you ever woken up one day
With the feeling that you'd been away?
If the girl that you dreamed of last night
Had the same dream, in the very same scene
With the very same boy, hold tight
It's a very special knowledge that you've got, my friend
You can travel anywhere with anyone you care
It's a very special knowledge that you've got, my friend
You can walk around in New York while you sleep in Penge
I will travel round the world one night
On the magic wings of astral flight
If you've got the secret, tell me do
Have you ever had a dream or two?
Have you ever had a dream or two?
Something like Tobacco Road
Living on a lonely road
I will pull you out of there
We will go to Finchley Fair
I will buy a feather hat
I will steal a cricket bat
Smash some windows, make a noise
We will run with Dirty Boys
When the sun goes down
When the sun goes down and the die is cast
When the die is cast and you have no choice
We will run with Dirty Boys
We all want men we all want you
Me and the boys we all go through
You've got to learn to hold your tongue
They said the moon was his burning son
When the sun goes down
When the sun goes down and the die is cast
When the die is cast and you have no choice
We will run with Dirty Boys
I'm home, lost my job, and incurably ill
You think this is easy, realism
I've got a girl out there, I suppose
I think she's dancing
Feel like Dan Dare lies down
I think she's dancing, what do I know?
I am a D.J., I am what I play
Can't turn around no, can't turn around, no, oh, ooh
I am a D.J., I am what I play
Can't turn around no, can't turn around, no, oh no
I am a D.J., I am what I play
I got believers (kiss-kiss)
Believing me, oh
One more, weekend, of lights and evening faces
Fast food, living nostalgia
Humble pie or bitter fruit
I am a D.J., I am what I play
Can't turn around no, can't turn around no, ooh
I am a D.J., I am what I say
Can't turn around no, can't turn around, ooh
I am a D.J., I am what I play
I've got believers (kiss-kiss)
Believing me
I am a D.J., I am what I play
Can turn around no, can't turn around
I am a D.J., I am what I play
Can turn around no, can't turn around
I am a D.J., I am what I play
Can turn around no (kiss-kiss)
Time flies when you're having fun
Break his heart, break her heart
He used to be my boss and now he is a puppet dancer
I am a D.J., and I've got believers
I've got believers
I've got believers
I've got believers in me
I've got believers
I am a D.J., I am what I play
I am a D.J.
Press control and D to bookmark Don't Look Down Don't look down
They're making sorta crazy sounds
Don't look down, no
Don't know who else came to kneel
On this empty battlefield
But when I hear that crazy sound, I don't look down
From Central Park to shanty town
I always hear that crazy sound
From New York to shanty town
There's always something else
Don't look down, no
I went this morning to the cemetery
To see old Rudy Valentino buried
Lipstick traces on his name
He never looked down
'Cause they were making crazy sounds
From Central park to shanty town
He always heard that crazy sound
There's always something else
Don't look down, no
When I see you standing there
I can't see the clothes you wear
I just hear that crazy sound
And I can't look down
From Central Park to shanty town
I've always heard that crazy sound
From New York to shanty town
There's always something else
Don't look down, no
Don't look down
Don't look, don't look down
No I won't be bored I won't be there
Look at life it's no piece of cake
When I hear that crazy sound
I don't look down
From Central Park to shanty town
I always hear that crazy sound
From New York to shanty town
There's always something else
Don't look down
Don't look down, no
Well, don't look, don't look down
(uh uh aaah) Let me put my arms around your head
(dom do aaah) Gee, it's hot, let's go to bed
Don't forget to turn on the light
Don't laugh babe, it'll be alright
(dom do aaah) Pour me out another phone
(dom do aaah) I'll ring and see if your friends are home
Perhaps the strange ones in the dome
Can lend us a book we can read up alone
And try to get it on like once before
When people stared in Jagger's eyes and scored
Like the video films we saw
His name was always buddy (got got do aaah aah aah)
And he'd shrug and ask to stay
She'd sigh like twig the wonder kid (got got do aaah)
And turn her face away
She's uncertain if she likes him (got got do aaah aah aah)
But she knows she really loves him
It's a crash course for the ravers (got got do aaah)
It's a drive-in Saturday
Jung the foreman prayed at work (dom do aaah)
Neither hands nor limbs would burst
It's hard enough to keep formation with this fall out saturation
(bah dom bah) cursing at the astronette
(dom do aaah) who stands in steel by his cabinet
He's crashing out with Sylvian
The bureau supply for aging men
With snorting head he gazes to the shore
Once had raised a sea that raged no more
Like the video films we saw
His name was always buddy (got got do aaah aah aah)
And he'd shrug and ask to stay
She'd sigh like twig the wonder kid (got got do aaah)
And turn her face away
She's uncertain if she likes him (got got do aaah aah aah)
But she knows she really loves him
It's a crash course for the ravers (got got do aaah)
It's a drive-in Saturday
His name was always buddy (got got do aaah aah aah)
And he'd shrug and ask to stay
She'd sigh like twig the wonder kid (got got do aaah)
And turn her face away
She's uncertain if she likes him (got got do aaah aah aah)
But she knows she really loves him
It's a crash course for the ravers (got got do aaah)
It's a drive-in Saturday, yeah, yeah
(drive-in saturday)
(it's a drive-in saturday)
(it's a drive-in saturday)
Drive in Saturday
(it's a drive-in saturday)
It's a, it's a, it's a drive in Saturday

It's a, it's a, it's a, yes sir, yes sir, yes sir, yes sir, yes sir,
Yes sir

Dom do do da, dom do do da

Said you took a big trip
They said you moved away
Happened oh, so quietly
They say
Shoulda took a picture
Something I could keep
Buy a little frame
Something cheap
For you
Everyone says hi
Said you sailed a big ship
Said you sailed away
Didn't know the right thing
To say
I'd love to get a letter
Like to know what's what
Hope the weather's good
And it's not too hot
For you
Everyone says hi
Everyone says hi
Everyone says
Don't stay in a sad place
Where they don't care how you are
Everyone says hi
If the money is lousy
You can always come home
We can do the old things
We can do all the bad things
If the food gets you leery
You can always phone
We could do all the good things
We could do it, we could do it,
We could do it
Don't stay in a bad place
Where they don't care how you are
Everyone says hi
Everyone says hi
Everyone says hi
And the girl next door
And the guy upstairs
Everyone says hi
And your mum and dad
Everyone says hi
And your big fat dog
Everyone says hi
Everyone says hi
Hi hi hi hi
David Bowie - Fly
The televisions on and I'm walking throught the yard
How's this life that sweet when I'm crying in the car
Dying for the weekend
The kids are alright but they don't smell much
The sellup in the garage in the decks and the stuff
Dying for the weekend
The boys on a charge but his mother doesn't know
I never got around yet I tell it my soul
But we only make it crazy
We'll I'll be fine, I'm only screaming in my head
But I can fly, I close my eyes and I can fly
The televisions on and I'm walking throught the yard
How's this life that sweet when I'm crying in my car
Dying for the weekend
The kids are gonna get it in an all right way
Looking pretty though but I still want to say
(Do you really have to go?)
Down in the backstreet the skinny get cries
Bad judge saturday another life line
Dying for the weekend
We'll I'll be fine, I'm only screaming in my head
But I can fly, I close my eyes and I can fly
When I can fly and fall to all the end and I can fly
I'll be fine, I'm only screaming in my head
I can fly, I close my eyes and I can fly
And in the death,
As the last few corpses lay rotting on the slimy
Thoroughfare,
The shutters lifted in inches in Temperance Building,
High on Poacher's Hill.
And red, mutant, eyes gaze down on Hunger City.
No more big wheels.
Fleas the size of rats sucked on rats the size of cats,
And ten thousand peoploids split into small tribes,
Coveting the highest of the sterile skyscrapers,
Like packs of dogs assaulting the glass fronts of Love-Me Avenue.
Ripping and rewrapping mink and shiny silver fox, now leg-warmers.
Family badge of sapphire and cracked emerald.
Any day now,
The year of the Diamond Dogs.
This ain't Rock'n'Roll,
This is Genocide.
The gospel according to tony day
The gospel according to tony day
The gospel according to tony day
If I find a girl he'll take her away
Rotten tony!
The gospel according to brendan o'lear
The gospel according to brendan o'lear
The gospel according to brendan o'lear
If I buy him a scotch, he'll buy me a beer
Tight fist, friends
The gospel according to pat hewitt
The gospel according to pat hewitt
The gospel according to pat hewitt
If it's written on a sweater then I'd better not, you do it
Ah
Got to, got to
Your mind, blow I
Blow it
The gospel according to marianne brent
The gospel according to marianne brent
The gospel according to marianne brent
She'll be mine if I pay the rent
Good old marianne, who needs friends, oh
That's the fucking time, take a look at my life and you'll see
Take a quick, butchers, rotten mary down the oak
Wouldn't give me two pence for him
Then we saw
Mission is dark
Trapped between the rocks
Blocking the waterfall
The songs of dust
The world would end
The night was always falling
The peacock in the snow
And I tell myself,
I don't know who I am
And I tell myself,
I don't know who I am
My father ran the prison
My father ran the prison
I can only love you
By hating him more
That's not the truth,
It's too big a word
He believed
That love is theft
Love and war,
The theft of love
And I tell myself,
I don't know who I am
And I tell myself,
I don't know who I am
My father ran the prison
My father ran the prison
But I am a seer, I am a liar
I am a seer, but I am a liar
My father ran the prison
My father ran the prison
You're like a sailor with a girl on every shore
Stay with them now for they won't see you any more
Like a gypsy forever on the run
Stay for a while, while ya look for a whore
Like that sailor leaves, come back again
Stay for a while, and they won't see you again
Like that gypsy caravan forever on the run
Ya stay for a while, then you pick up and go
[Chorus:]
That's how you show
Your love for me
That's how you show
Your love for me
You're like
Here today
Gone tomorrow
Each time you call
You leave a little sorrow
You're like
Here today
Gone tomorrow
Each time you call
You leave a little sorrow
You're like
You're like that big, big star, he's tore the town apart
Givin' everyone to console their aching heart
Like that snow that fell, looks so wrong and out of place
Stay for a while, then you leave without a trace
That's 'xactly like that star, he tore the town apart
Leave everyone to console their aching heart
Like that snow that fell, looks so wrong and out of place
Stay for a while, leave without a trace
[Chorus:]
You're like
Here today
Gone tomorrow
Each time you call
You leave a little sorrow
You're like
Like
Oooh-huh
Oh-ho
Here today
Gone tomorrow
Hmmm, like
You're like
You're like
Here today
Gone tomorrow
Each time you call
You leave a little sorrow
You're like

Here today
Gone tomorrow
Each time you call
You leave a little sorrow
You're like
Yeah
Here today
Here today but gone tomorrow

I, I will be king
And you, you will be queen
Though nothing, will drive them away
We can beat them, just for one day
We can be heroes, just for one day
And you, you can be mean
And I, I'll drink all the time
'Cause we're lovers, and that is a fact
Yes we're lovers, and that is that
Though nothing, will keep us together
We could steal time, just for one day
We can be heroes, forever and ever
What'd you say?
I, I wish you could swim
Like the dolphins, like dolphins can swim
Though nothing, nothing will keep us together
We can beat them, forever and ever
Oh we can be heroes, just for one day
I, I will be king
And you, you will be queen
Though nothing will drive them away
We can be heroes, just for one day
We can be us, just for one day
I, I can remember (I remember)
Standing, by the wall (by the wall)
And the guns, shot above our heads (over our heads)
And we kissed, as though nothing could fall (nothing could fall)
And the shame, was on the other side
Oh we can beat them, forever and ever
Then we could be heroes, just for one day
We can be heroes
We can be heroes
We can be heroes
Just for one day
We can be heroes
We're nothing, and nothing will help us
Maybe we're lying, then you better not stay
But we could be safer, just for one day
Oh-oh-oh-ohh, oh-oh-oh-ohh, just for one day
Listen baby, let me lie low, lie low with you
To be lie-high-high-high
High-high lie-low lie
Slowly, it's good and holy
Helping one another, just a righteous brother
Lifetime, give me back my lifetime
I don't want to be an angel, just a little bit evil
Feel the devil in me
Holy, holy
Hold on to anyone, hold on to anyone
But just let me be
Holy, holy
Hold on to anyone, hold on to anyone
But let go of me
Listen baby, let me lie low, lie low with you
To be a lie-high-high-high
High-high my oh my
Holy, holy
Hold on to anyone, hold on to anyone
But just let me be
Holy, holy
Hold on to anyone, hold on to anyone
But let go of me
New feeling inside
It's a hot certain kind
I feel hot and cold
Down my soul, baby
I can't explain
Going out of my mind
Dizzy in the head, and I'm feeling blue
Things you say well maybe they're true
I get funny dreams again and again
Knows what it means, but
Can't explain
I think it's love
Say it to you
When I feel blue
I can't explain, no, I can't explain
You know I can't explain
I'm going out of my mind
Well I'm a worried guy
But I can't explain
I've got the village I love - dig everything
I walk along beside the garbagemen and I dig everything - dig everything
I wave to the policemen, but they don't wave back
They don't dig anything - dig everything
Ain't had a job for a year or more and I don't know a thing - dig everything
Everything's spent and I dig everything
Everything's spent and I dig everything
Dig
I feed the lions in trafalgar square and I dig everything - dig everything
I've sit just behind my window, till my cigarettes were low and dug
Everything -dig everything
Got a backstreet room in the bad part of town and I dig everything - dig
everything
I'd see people in the street below, who don't know where they're going
They don't dig anything - dig everything
Everything's spent and I dig everything
Everything's spent and I dig everything
Dig
I've got more friends than I had out for dinners
Some of them were losers, but the rest of them are winners
Rick, john, sally, a connection named paul
Holy low on money, their intentions are tall
We smoke and talk in my room and we dig everything
Dig
I've made myself at home -dig everything
I've made good friends which the time-check girl on the end of the phone
All the movie shows - dig everything
I sunbathe for love - dig everything
Even when it's not too hot - dig everything
'cause I dig everything -dig everything
Oh yeah
Dear when I dance with you
We move like the sea
You, you're all I want to know
I feel free
I feel free
I can walk down the street
There's no one there
The pavement is one huge crowd
I can drive down the road
My eyes can't see
But my mind wants to cry out loud
I can walk down the street
There's no one there
The pavement is one huge crowd
I can drive down the road
My eyes can't see
But my mind wants to cry out loud
My mind wants to cry out loud
I feel free
Dance floor is like the sea
The ceiling is the sky
You're the sun, and as you shine on me
I feel free
I feel free
I feel free
Baby Grace is the victim
She was 14 years of age
And the wheels are turning, turning
For the finger points at me
(All's well)
But I have not been to Oxford Town
(All's well)
No I have not been to Oxford Town
Toll the bell
Pay the private eye
(All's well)
20th century dies
And the prison priests are decent
My attorney seems sincere
I fear my days are numbered
Lord get me out of here
(All's well)
But I have not been to Oxford Town
All's well)
But I have not been to Oxford Town
Toll the bell
Pay the private eye
(All's well)
20th century dies
This is your shadow on my wall
This is my flesh and blood
This is what I could've been
And the wheels are turning and turning
As the 20th century dies
If I had not ripped the fabric
If time had not stood still
If I had not met Ramona
If I'd only paid my bill
(All's well)
But I have not been to Oxford Town
(All's well)
But I have not been to Oxford Town
Toll the bell
Pay the private eye
(All's well)
20th century dies
This is my bunk with two sheets
This is my food though foul
This is what I could have been
Toll the bell
Pay the private eye
(All's well)
20th century dies
Toll the bell
Pay the private eye
(All's well)
20th century dies
(All's well)
20th century dies
(All's well)
All's well, all's well
Toll the bell
Pay the private eye
(All's well)
20th century dies
Toll the bell
Pay the private eye
(All's well)
20th century dies
[Chorus: x2]
I keep forgetting you don't love me no more
I keep forgetting that you told me that you
Didn't want me around any more
But these stupid old feet
Just head for your street
Like they've done so many times before
And this stubborn old fist
On the end of my wrist
Keeps a knocking on your front door
[Chorus: x2]
I keep forgetting you don't love me no more
I keep forgetting bout those heartbreaking nights
And those heartbreaking things
That you said
Though I know in my heart
We're drifting apart
I can't believe that our love is dead
Though it's plain as can be
That you're finished with me
I just can't get it through my head
[Chorus: x2]
Though I know in my heart
We're drifting apart
I can't believe that our love is dead
Though it's plain as can be
That you're finished with me
I just can't get it through my head
[Chorus: x5]
Well, I pity the fool, I said, I pity the fool
You know, I pity the fool, I said, I pity the fool
That falls all in love with you and expects you to be true
I pity the fool
Well, look at the people
I bet you wonder what they do
Yeah, they're just standing there
Watching you making a fool out of me
Yeah, look at the people
I bet you wonder what they do
Yeah, they're just standing there
Watching you making a fool out of me
I pity the fool, I said, I pity the fool
Ooh, I pity the fool, let me tell you that I pity the fool
Cause she'll break your heart one day and she'll laugh as she walks away
Well, I pity the fool
Yeah, look at the people
Bet you wonder what they do
Well, they're just standing there
Watching you making a fool out of me
Yeah, look at the people
Bet you wonder what they do
Well, they're just standing there
Watching you making a fool out of me
I pity the fool, I pity the fool that falls in love with you
Hey, hey, yeah, I pity the fool
I pity the fool that falls in love with you
Took a trip on a Gemini spacecraft
And I thought about you
I passed through the shadow of Jupiter
And I thought about you
I shot my space gun
And boy I really felt blue
Two or three flying saucers
Parked under the stars, winding stream
Moon shining down on some little town
And with each beam the same old dream
I took a trip on a Gemini spacecraft
And I thought about you
Well I shot my spacegun
And I thought about you
Pulled down my sun visor
Boy, I really felt blue
You jumped into your Gemini, I jumped into mine
We'll orbit the Moon for just one time
Tomorrow night, tomorrow night
Will you hold hands with me under the moonlight?
Took a trip in a Gemini spacecraft
And I thought about you
I shot my space gun
And I thought about you
And I took a, I took a walk in space
Boy, I really felt blue
Well I peeked through the crack and looked way back
Stardust trail leading back to you
What did I do? What could I do? What did I do?
Well
I thought about you
I thought about you
Took a trip on a Gemini spacecraft
And thought about you
Walking in the snowy street
Let me understand
Drifting down a silent park
Stumbling over land
Open up your heart to me
Show me who you are
And I would be your slave
Do you sleep in quietude?
Do you walk in peace?
Do you laugh out loud at me?
No one else that is free
Open up your heart to me
Show me all you are
And I would be your slave
I don't sit around and wait
I don't give a damn
I don't see the point at all
No footprints in the sand
I bet you laugh out loud at me
A chance to strike me down
Give me peace of mind at last
Show me all you are
Open up your heart to me
And I would be your slave
I don't sit and wait
I don't give a damn
I don't see the point at all
No footprints in the sand
I would give you all my love
Nothing else is free
Open up your heart to me
And I would be your slave
If you can see me I can see you
I could wear your new blue shoes
I should wear your old red dress
And walk to the crossroads
So take this knife
And meet me across the river
Just shoots and ladders and this is the kiss
American ?
From nowhere to nothing
And I go way back
Children swarm like thousands of bugs
Towards the lights the beacons above the hill
The stars to the West, the South, the North and to the East
Now you could say I've got a gift of sorts
A fear of rear windows and swinging doors
A love of violence and dread of sighs
If you can see me I can see you
If you can see me I can see you
I have seen these bairns wave their fists at God
Swear to destroy the beasts, stamping the ground
In their excitement for tomorrow
I could wear your new blue shoes
I should wear your old red dress
And walk to the crossroads
So take this knife
And meet me across the river
I will take your lands and all that lays beneath
The dust of cold flowers, prison of dark of ashes
I will slaughter your kind who descend from belief
I am the spirit of greed, a lord of theft
I'll burn all your books and the problems they make
If you can see me I can see you
If you can see me.
Funny how secrets travel
I'd start to believe if I were to bleed
Thin skies, the man chains his hands held high
Cruise me blond
Cruise me babe
A blond belief beyond beyond beyond
No return No return
I'm deranged
Deranged my love
I'm deranged down down down
So cruise me babe cruise me baby
CHORUS
And the rain sets in
It's the angel-man
I'm deranged
Cruise me cruise me cruise me babe
The clutch of life and the fist of love
Over your head
Big deal Salaam
Be real deranged Salaam
Before we reel
I'm deranged
CHORUS (two times)
Cruise me cruise me cruise me babe
Yes, I've read the morning papers
Telling me that you've made money
Do you think I'm gonna crawl, then think again
Though I'm dressed in rags, I'm richer
Though I eat from tins, I'm healthier
Though I live in slums, I'm purer than you, my friend
Too bad, I'm not losing sleep
[Too bad] I'm just counting sheep
[Too bad] I'm not losing sleep, my friend
Look around and see the friends
The ones you left, our friends deserted
See the guys that used to talk and drink with you
Don't look down your nose at me
'Cause I won't ask your sympathy
I won't be your yes-sir man for anything
Too bad, I'm not losing sleep
[Too bad] I'm just counting sheep
[Too bad] I'm not losing sleep, my friend
I would walk with you
Talk with you, drink with you
If you drop that halo that you're wearing on the ground
Too bad, I'm not losing sleep
[Too bad] I'm just counting sheep
[Too bad] I'm not losing sleep, my friend
I can't get my satisfaction
Knowing you won't get reaction
What makes me the big attraction anyway
It's too bad, I'm not losing sleep
[Too bad] I'm just counting sheep
[Too bad] I'm not losing sleep, my friend
Too bad, I'm not losing sleep
[Too bad] I'm just counting sheep
[Too bad] I'm not losing sleep, my friend
Oh, it's too bad, I'm not losing sleep
[Too bad] I'm just counting sheep
[Too bad] I'm not losing sleep, my friend
The blazing sunset in your eyes will tantalize
Every man who looks your way
I watched them sink before your gaze
Seniorita sway
Dance with me before their frozen eyes
I'm so much in love
Like a little soldier catching butterflies
No man loved like I love you
Wouldn't you like to love me too
In the heat of the morning
In the shadow I'll clip your wings
And I'll tell you I love you
In the heat of the morning
I'll tie a knot in rainbow's end, organise the breeze
Light my candle from the sun
I'll give you daylight for a friend
I'll do all of these
I'll prove that it can be done, oh, I'm so much in love
Like the ragged boy who races with the wind
No man loved like I love you
Wouldn't you like to love me too
In the heat of the morning
In the shadow I'll clip your wings
And I'll tell you I love you
In the heat of the morning
In the heat of the morning
In the shadow I'll clip your wings
And I'll tell you I love you
In the heat of the morning
Oh yeah, all day, all the way
Ooh
When you climb to the top of the mountain
Look out over the sea
Think about the places perhaps, where a young man could be
Then you jump back down to the rooftops
Look out over the town
Think about all of the strange things circulating round
[CHORUS]
It ain't easy, it ain't easy
It ain't easy to get to heaven when you're going down
Well all the people have got their problems
That ain't nothing new
With the help of the good Lord
We can all pull on through
We can all pull on through
Get there in the end
Sometimes it'll take you right up and sometimes down again
[CHORUS]
Satisfaction, satisfaction
Keep me satisfied
I've got the love of a Hoochie Koochie woman
She calling from inside
She's a-calling from inside
Trying to get to you
All the woman really wants you can give her something
Too
[CHORUS (x2)]
I had skin like leather and the diamond-hard look of a cobra
I was born blue and weathered but I burst just like a supernova
I could walk like Brando right into the sun
Then dance just like a Casanova
With my blackjack and jacket and hair slicked sweet
Silver star studs on my duds like a Harley in heat
When I strut down the street I could hear its heartbeat
The sisters fell back and said Don't that man look pretty
The cripple on the corner cried out Nickels for your pity
Them gasoline boys downtown sure talk gritty
It's so hard to be a saint in the city
I was the king of the alley, mama, I could talk some trash
I was the prince of the paupers crowned downtown at the beggar's bash
I was the pimp's main prophet I kept everything cool
Just a backstreet gambler with the luck to lose
And when the heat came down it was left on the ground
The devil appeared like Jesus through the steam in the street
Showin' me a hand I knew even the cops couldn't beat
I felt his hot breath on my neck as I dove into the heat
It's so hard to be a saint when you're just a boy out on the street
And the sages of the subway sit just like the living dead
As the tracks clack out the rhythm their eyes fixed straight ahead
They ride the line of balance and hold on by just a thread
But it's too hot in these tunnels you can get hit up by the heat
You get up to get out at your next stop but they push you back down in your
seat
Your heart starts beatin' faster as you struggle to your feet
Then you're outta that hole and back up on the street
And them South Side sisters sure look pretty
The cripple on the corner cries out Nickels for your pity
And them downtown boys sure talk gritty
It's so hard to be a saint in the city
(I've been looking, I've been looking)
(I've been looking, I've been looking)
I've been looking
For a woman
To save my life
Not to beg or to borrow
A woman with a feeling
of loosing once or twice
Who knows how it could be
Be tomorrow
I've been waiting for you
And you've been coming to me
For such a long time now
For such a long time now
A woman with a feeling
Of loosing once or twice
Who knows how it could be
Be tomorrow
I've been waiting for you
And you've been coming to me
For such a long time now
For such a long time now
For such a long time now
For such a long time now
I don't want to lose the good thing that I've got
If I do, I will surely, I will lose a lot
For your love is better than any love other I've know
It's like thunder, lightning
The way you love me is frightening
I better knock on wood
Baby
I got superstitious about you, but I can't take change
You got me spinning, baby, spinning in a trance
But your love is better than any other love I've known
It's like thunder, lightning
The way you love me is frightening
You better knock on wood
It's no secret, but that woman fills my loving cup
She sees, so ready, that I get enough
And her love is better than any other love I've known
It's like thunder
It's like lightning
The way you love me is frightening
I better knock on wood
Baby
Better, yes, better
(yes you better knock, knock, knock on wood) yes, I better
(yes you better knock, knock, knock on wood) oh, knock on wood
(yes you better knock, knock, knock on wood) you know I would, would
(yes you better knock, knock, knock on wood) it's no secret
(yes you better knock, knock, knock on wood) no, oh, better
(yes you better knock, knock, knock on wood) hangin' above me
(yes you better knock, knock, knock on wood) I can't leave her
(yes you better knock, knock, knock on wood) oh no, baby
Knock on wood, woo!
[CHORUS (x2)]
Will you stay in our lovers' story
If you stay you won't be sorry
'Cause we believe in you
Soon you'll grow so take a chance
With a couple of Kooks
Hung up on romancing
We bought a lot of things
To keep you warm and dry
And a funny old crib on which the paint won't dry
I bought you a pair of shoes
A trumpet you can blow
And a book of rules
On what to say to people
When they pick on you
'Cause if you stay with us you're gonna be pretty Kookie too
[CHORUS]
And if you ever have to go to school
Remember how they messed up
This old fool
Don't pick fights with the bullies
Or the cads
'Cause I'm not much cop at punching other people's Dads
And if the homework brings you down
Then we'll throw it on the fire
And take the car downtown
[CHORUS (repeat ad inf.)]
She'll come, she'll go. She'll lay belief on you
Skin sweet with musky oil
The lady from another grinning soul
Cologne she'll wear. Silver and Americard
She'll drive a beetle car
And beat you down at cool Canasta
And when the clothes are strewn don't be afraid of the room
Touch the fullness of her breast. Feel the love of her caress
She will be your living end
She'll come, she'll go. She'll lay belief on you
But she won't stake her life on you
How can life become her point of view
And when the clothes are strewn don't be afraid of the room
Touch the fullness of her breast. Feel the love of her caress
She will be your living end
She will be your living end
She will be your living end
She will be your living end
She will be your living
People stared at the makeup on his face
Laughed at his long black hair, his animal grace
The boy in the bright blue jeans
Jumped up on the stage
And lady stardust sang his songs
Of darkness and disgrace
And he was alright, the band was altogether
Yes he was alright, the song went on forever
And he was awful nice
Really quite out of sight
And he sang all night long
Femme fatales emerged from shadows
To watch this creature fair
Boys stood upon their chairs
To make their point of view
I smiled sadly for a love
I could not obey
Lady stardust sang his songs
Of darkness and dismay
And he was alright, the band was altogether
Yes he was alright, the song went on forever
And he was awful nice
Really quite paradise
Oh how I sighed when they asked if I knew his name
And he was alright, the band was altogether
Yes he was alright, the song went on forever
And he was awful nice
Really quite out of sight

Baby, baby, brush the dust of youth from your shoulder
Because the years of fretting days are right behind you now
Don't return to fields of green where rainbow secrets were told
Place your ragged doll with all the toys and things and deeds
I will show you a game where the winner never wins
Let your hair hang down, wear the dress your mother wore
Let me sleep beside you
Lock away your childhood and throw away the key
For now the streets and city sounds will burn your eyes as coals
We shall drink the oldest wine and velvet skies will linger
Child, you're a woman now, your heart and soul are free
I will boldly light that lamp and we shall walk together
Let your hair hang down, wear the dress your mother wore
Let me sleep beside you
Your darkened eyes throw mystery
But your lips are void of history
You could not imagine that it could happen this way, could you
I will give you dreams and I'll tell you things you'll like to hear
Let your hair hang down, wear the dress your mother wore
Let me sleep beside you
Let me sleep beside you
Let's dance
Put on your red shoes and dance the blues
Let's dance
Dance to the song they're playing on the radio
Let's sway
While color lights up your face
Let's sway
Sway through the crowd to an empty space
If you say run, I'll run with you
If you say hide, we'll hide
Watch my love for you
It would break my heart in two
If you should fall into my arms
And tremble like a flower
Let's dance
For fear your grace should fall
Let's dance
For fear tonight is all
Let's sway
You can look into my eyes
Let's sway
Underthe moonlight, the Sirius moonlight
If you say run, I'll run with you
If you say hide, we'll hide
Watch my love for you
It would break my heart in two
If you should fall into my arms
And tremble like a flower
Let's dance
Let's dance
Let's dance, let's dance
Let's dance, let's dance
The hand that wrote this letter
Sweeps the pillow clean.
So rest your head and read a treasured dream.
I care for no one else but you.
I tear my soul to cease the pain.
I think maybe you feel the same,
What can we do?
I'm not quite sure what we're supposed to do.
So I've been writing just for you.
They say your life is going very well.
They say you sparkle like a different girl.
But something tells me that you hide
When all the world is warm and tired.
You cry a little in the dark,
Well so do I.
I'm not quite sure what you're supposed to say,
But I can see it's not okay.
He makes you laugh.
He brings you out in style.
He treats you well
And makes you up real fine.
And when he's strong,
He's strong for you.
And when you kiss
It's something new.
But did you ever call my name
Just by mistake?
I'm not quite sure what I'm supposed to do.
So I'll just write some love to you.
CHORUS
Life is a circus
It's not fair
Life is a hard road
When you're not there
At the fair
Friends come to see me
[and the ...](point where shall I go)
To see the show
[to help my friend and foe]
[all that ..]
When will they realize
[To laugh and drag my name on the ground]
The circus must go
[Looking at the strengths of every]

Papa he talks to me
Don't try your heart
Gets deep inside you
Does you real harm
Don't you care?
Life ??
[and the ...]
Stand straight and true
[to help my friend and foe]
[Why let them ](Oh let them fight)
Fight your
Christ don't tell
It's a God-awful small affair
To the girl with the mousy hair
But her mummy is yelling No
And her daddy has told her to go
But her friend is nowhere to be seen
Now she walks through her sunken dream
To the seat with the clearest view
And she's hooked to the silver screen
But the film is a saddening bore
For she's lived it ten times or more
She could spit in the eyes of fools
As they ask her to focus on
Sailors fighting in the dance hall
Oh man! Look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the Lawman
Beating up the wrong guy
Oh man! Wonder if he'll ever know
He's in the best selling show
Is there life on Mars?
It's on America's tortured brow
That Mickey Mouse has grown up a cow
Now the workers have struck for fame
'Cause Lennon's on sale again
See the mice in their million hordes
From Ibiza to the Norfolk Broads
Rule Britannia is out of bounds
To my mother, my dog, and clowns
But the film is a saddening bore
'Cause I wrote it ten times or more
It's about to be writ again
As I ask you to focus on
Sailors fighting in the dance hall
Oh man! Look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the Lawman
Beating up the wrong guy
Oh man! Wonder if he'll ever know
He's in the best selling show
Is there life on Mars?
War made him a soldier
Little Frankie Mear
Peace left him a loser
The little bombardier
Lines of worry appeared with age
Unskilled hands that knew no trade
Spent his time in the picture house
The little bombardier
Frankie drank his money
The little that he made
Told his woes to no man
Friendless, lonely days
Then one day, in the ABC
Four bright eyes gazed longinly
At the ice-cream in the hand of
The little bombardier
Sunshine entered our Frankie's days
Gone his worries, his hopeless maze
His life was fun and his life was full of joy
Two young children had changed his aims
He gave them toffees and played their games
He brought them presents with every coins he made
Then two gentlemen called him
Asked him for his name
Why was he friends with the children
Were they just a game?
Leave them alone or we'll get sore
We've had blokes like you in the station before
The hand of authority said no more to
The little bombardier
Packed his bags, his heart in pain
Wiped a tear, caught a train
Not to be seen in the town again
Once upon a time there was a toy soldier and he lived in the play room
Once upon a time there was a toy soldier with a whip lash in his hand
And every night little girl sadie would take all her clothes off and wind up
the toy soldier and he raised his whip and said
On your knees little sadie
Little sadie on your knees
Taste the whip and love might given likely
Taste the whip and bleed for me
Little sadie loved her little toy soldier
And she run home from school each day
Little sadie loved her little toy soldier
And she locked her door so she could play
Little sadie got ambitious
And wound the clockworks so to tighter
So he could whip her harder and harder
On your knees little sadie
Little sadie on your knees
Taste the whip and love might given likely
Taste the whip and bleed for me
One day sadie wound and wound
And wound and wound
And wound and wound
Til suddenly the little toy soldier spring, went. . .
(ugly, beat her to death)
Ahhhh
Cough, cough, cough
Stinky weather fat, shaky hands
Dopey morning doc, grumpy gnomes
Little wonder then, little wonder
You little wonder, little wonder you
Big screen dolls, and explosions
Sleepy time bashful but nude
Little wonder then, little wonder
You little wonder, little wonder you
Enter galactic see me to be you
It's all in the tablets sneezy bhutan
You little wonder, little wonder
You little wonder, little wonder you
Mars happy nation sit on my karma
Dame meditation take me away
Little wonder then, little wonder
You little wonder, little wonder you
Sending me, so far away, so far away
Little wonder, little wonder you
Sending me, so far away, so far away
Little wonder, little wonder you
Well, I got a girl that's so good to me (little Liza)
Well, now she ain't more than five foot three (little Liza)
Well, this little girl is so good to me (little Liza)
Yeah, this little girl's nearly half of me (little Liza)
[Chorus]
Little Liza Jane [Repeat: x4]
I got a girl, ? (little Liza)
Yeah, this little girl turn me upside down (little Liza)
Well, all of the little girls that I had (little Liza)
You know this little girl drives me to despair (little Liza)
[Chorus]
Yeah, I got a girl who loves me true (little Liza)
Now she ain't more than five foot two, yeah (little Liza)
You know this little girl is so good for me, yeah (little Liza)
You know this little girl's nearly half of me (little Liza)
[Chorus]
Oh yeah, I love her
Little Liza Jane
Well, I'm coming back to me love
Cause she's driving insane
When will I meet her
Bow Bells strike another night
Your eyes are heavy and your limbs all ache
You've bought some coffee, butter and bread
You can't make a thing cause the meter's dead
You moved away
Told your folks you're gonna stay away
Bright lights, Soho, Wardour street
You hope you make friends with the guys that you meet
Somebody shows you round
Now you've met the London boys
Things seem good again, someone cares about you
Oh, the first time that you tried a pill
You feel a little queasy, decidedly ill
You're gonna be sick, but you mustn't lose faith
To let yourself down would be a big disgrace
With the London boys, with the London boys
You're only seventeen, but you think you've grown
In the month you've been away from your parents' home
You take the pills too much
You don't give a damn about that jobs you've got
So long as you're with the London boys
A London boy, oh a London boy
Your flashy clothes are your pride and joy
A London boy, a London boy
You think you've had a lot of fun
But you ain't got nothing, you're on the run
It's too late now, cause you're out there boy
You've got it made with the rest of the toys
Now you wish you'd never left your home
You've got what you wanted but you're on your own
With the London boys
Now you've met the London boys
Now you've met the London boys
Now you've met the London boys
It's the darkest hour, you're 22
The voice of youth, the hour of dread
It's the darkest hour, and your voice is new
Love is lost, and lost is love
Your country's new, your friends are new
Your house, and even your eyes are new
Your maid is new, and your accent, too
But your fear is as old as the world
Say goodbye to the thrills of life
When love was good, when love was bad
Wave goodbye to the life without pain
Say hello, your beautiful girl
Say hello to the greater men
Tell them your secrets they're like the grave
Oh what have you done, oh what have you done
Love is lost, lost is love
You know so much, it's making you cry
You refuse to talk, but you think like mad
You've cut out your zone and the things have fold
Oh what have you done, oh what have you done
Oh what have you done, oh what have you done
The words I have to say
May well be simple but they're true
Until you give your love
There's nothing more that we can do
Love is the opening door
Love is what we came here for
No-one can offer you more
You know what I mean
Have your eyes really seen?
You say you find it hard
To lead the life that we once knew
But there's no other way
So now it's really up to you
Love is the key we must turn
Truth is the flame we must learn
Freedom the lesson we must learn
Do you know what I mean?
Have your eyes really seen?
Love is the key we must turn
Truth is the flame we must burn
Freedom the lesson we must learn
Do you know what I mean?
Have your eyes really seen?
You say you find it hard
To lead the life that we once knew
But there's no other way
So now it's really up to you
Love is the key we must turn
Truth is the flame we must learn
Freedom the lesson we must learn
Do you know what I mean?
Have your eyes really seen?
Love is the key we must turn
Truth is the flame we must burn
Freedom the lesson we must learn
Do you know what I mean?
Have your eyes really seen?
Just look through your window, look who sits outside
Little me is waiting, standing through the night
When you walk out through your door I'll wave my flag and shout
Oh, beautiful baby
My burning desire started on Sunday
Give me your heart and I'll love you till Tuesday
Da da da dumb [Repeat: x4]
Who's that hiding in the apple tree, clinging to a branch
Don't be afraid it's only me, hoping for a little romance
If you lie beneath my shade, I'll keep you nice and cool
Oh, beautiful baby
I was very lonely till I met you on Sunday
My passion's never-ending and I'll love you till Tuesday
Da da da dumb [Repeat: x7]
Let the wind blow through your hair, be nice to the big blue sea
Don't be afraid of the man in the moon, because it's only me
I shall always watch you until my love runs dry
Ohh, beautiful baby
My heart's aflame, I'll love you till Tuesday
My head's in a whirl and I'll love you till Tuesday
Love, love, love, love you till Tuesday
Love, love, love, love you till Tuesday
Da da da dumb [Repeat: x11]
Well, I might stretch it till Wednesday
And as the sparrow sings
Dawn chorus for
Someone else to hear
The thinker sits alone growing older
And so bitter
She gave them life,
She gave them all
They drained her very soul dry...dry
Hey hey hey bitter girl
We're out to sitting here digging you
We flew done here just to figure you
It's easy
Don't be so bitter
Oh oh oh crazy girl
You gave too much and you got nothing
Too many problems and not one thing
In return
Left high and dry
Door
And as the sun rise stream
Flickers on
She finds lavender
To fight the beckoning
Watching them come and go
The templars and the saracens
They're traveling the holy land
Opening telegrams
Torture comes and torture goes
Knights who'd give you anything
They bear the cross of coeuf de leon
Salvation for the mirror blind
But if you pray all your sins are hooked upon the sky
Pray and the heathen lie will disappear
Prayers they hide the saddest view
(Believing the strangest things, loving the alien)
And your prayers they break the sky in two
(Believing the strangest things, loving the alien)
You pray til the break of dawn
(Believing the strangest things, loving the alien)
And you'll believe you're loving the alien
(Believing the strangest things, loving the alien)
Thinking of a different time
Palestine a modern problem
Bounty and your wealth in land
Terror in a best laid plan
Watching them come and go
Tomorrows and the yesterdays
Christians and the unbelievers
Hanging by the cross and nail
Hands out stretch, what you got
Give me your best and I won't turn you down
Cause you're always out to impress
You're always out to impress
You're always out to impress
This is the high life, nothing dragging us through the thorns
This is the best time to be young and then reborn
Live like we're gonna die
Do things we've never done before
This is the high life, the high life
No we won't say no
Beautiful people say go go go
Beautiful people don't stress stress stress
They never rest
Beautiful people say yes
No we won't say no
Beautiful people say go go go
Beautiful people don't stress stress stress
They never rest
Beautiful people say yes
Hands out stretch, what you got
Give me your best and I won't turn you down
Cause you're always out to impress
Always out to impress
Always out to impress
So come come come with me
Let's push on 'til the break of dawn
I love to party
And when I'm with you give me some
I've got the view you see
Ready set go I drop the bomb
This is the high life
The high life
No we won't say no
Beautiful people say go go go
Beautiful people don't stress stress stress
They never rest
Beautiful people say yes
No we won't say no
Beautiful people say go go go
Beautiful people don't stress stress stress
They never rest
Beautiful people say yes
